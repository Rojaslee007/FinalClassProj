            <h2>Where Would You Go?</h2>
            <p>
A trip I have planned is Malaysia for the summer of 2027. I would begin our trip at Redang Island which is an island beyond the northeastern side of the country. After about a week there, my wife and I would head south to the capital city for an additional 2 weeks, Kuala Lumpur. We have recently visited and felt like we wanted to spend more time there to experience more. Afterwards, head south for an area along the coast called Malacca for an additional week. It is a scenic and walkable town that I believe my wife would enjoy.             </p>

            <h2>What Would You Eat?</h2>
            <p>
				<h3>Nasi Lamek which is one of Malaysia's traditional meals</h3>
	<h4>Ingredients:</h4>
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
	<li>White Rice</li>
	<li>Chicken</li>
	<li>Boiled Eggs</li>
	<li>Tiny Fried Fish</li>
	<li>Sliced Cucumbers</li>
	<li>Signature Sauce</li>
	</ul>

				<br>
				Beyond the Nasi Lamek, the food of choice would be all things fresh, local, and focused on seafood. Every meal would include freshly caught fish (grilled, not fried), exotic fruits like mango and passionfruit, and light coconut curries. The perfect treat would be a local fruit smoothie served in a coconut shell on the beach, the occasional cocktails, and of course random bazar things I haven't tried in America. My wife and I are foodies and love a good mystery.
